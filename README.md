## Code for Cluster Abundances Constraints on Modified Gravity (MG) Models

This repository stores code that calculates the constraints on MG models using Ïƒ8, the mean amplitude of the matter power spectrum over large cosmic scales, based on the forecasts of the abundances of galaxy clusters in https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07502v2.
